1- math exam but if you cant do it , it'll bully you!!

to run on ipad/ios devices you need an Python IDE or online python file viewer sites

to run on android devices you need an 3rd party code editor or if your storage is full you can use online ones

to run on linux devices just use "python3 a.py"
